# Siamese Network Example

Siamese network for image similarity estimation.
The network is composed of two identical networks, one for each input.
The output of each network is concatenated and passed to a linear layer. 
The output of the linear layer passed through a sigmoid function.
`"FaceNet" <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf>`_ is a variant of the Siamese network.
This implementation varies from FaceNet as we use the `ResNet-18` model from
`"Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf>`_ as our feature extractor.
In addition, we aren't using `TripletLoss` as the MNIST dataset is simple, so `BCELoss` can do the trick.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Optionally, you can add the following tags to customize your execution.

```bash
--batch-size            input batch size for training (default: 64)
--test-batch-size       input batch size for testing (default: 1000)
--epochs                number of epochs to train (default: 14)
--lr                    learning rate (default: 1.0)
--gamma                 learning rate step gamma (default: 0.7)
--no-cuda               disables CUDA training
--no-xpu                disables XPU training
--no-mps                disables macOS GPU training
--dry-run               quickly check a single pass
--seed                  random seed (default: 1)
--log-interval          how many batches to wait before logging training status
--save-model            Saving the current Model
```

If a GPU device is detected, the example will be executed on the GPU by default; otherwise, it will run on the CPU.

To disable the GPU option, add the appropriate tag to the command. For example:

```bash
python main.py --no-xpu
```

This command will execute the example on the CPU even if your system successfully detects an XPU.
